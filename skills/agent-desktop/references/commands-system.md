# System Commands

App lifecycle, windows, notifications, clipboard, wait, batch, sessions, health. Run `agent-desktop <command> --help` for flags.

## launch

```bash
agent-desktop launch "System Settings"       # macOS display name
agent-desktop launch "TextEdit" --activate
agent-desktop launch "MyTool" --arg /tmp/notes.txt --env KEY=VALUE --no-attach
agent-desktop launch "Obsidian" --cdp
```

`launch` returns once the process runs. The identifier differs by OS: the examples below use macOS display names, and Windows needs an absolute path or a System32 name (platform skill). By default it attaches to a running instance. `--no-attach` returns `ACTION_FAILED` if a matching app is running. It starts a new instance only when none is running. For an `--arg` value that starts with `-`, use `--arg=<value>`.

The process running and the app showing a window are separate facts:

```json
{ "app": "TextEdit", "pid": 611, "window": { "id": "w-110407", "title": "Open", "visible": true } }
```

- `window` is present when the app already has one, and omitted when it has none. Its absence is not a failure. `launch` still returns `ok: true`.
- A document-based app may open its first window only when brought forward. Use `--activate`: it asks the app to present a window and waits for it up to `--timeout` (default 30000). This brings the app forward, so it is not headless. Or trigger the window yourself and use `wait --event window-opened`.
- A process that exits before it shows a window returns `APP_UNRESPONSIVE`.
- Windowless and menu-bar-only apps report no `window`. Use `list-apps` and read `presentation`.
- An app built on Chromium may return `renderer: "chromium"` and a `suggestion`. These are hints. The accessibility path still works. A missing `renderer` never proves the app is native.

### Web contents of a Chromium app (`--cdp`)

Use `--cdp` for Electron and Chromium apps whose web contents are dense or slow to walk (Slack, VS Code, Discord, Obsidian, Notion). It launches the app fresh with a loopback-only debugging port, polls until the endpoint answers, then returns. Pass a port, or omit it to let the OS pick a free one.

```json
{ "app": "Obsidian", "pid": 4821, "cdp": { "port": 9229, "http_endpoint": "http://127.0.0.1:9229",
  "websocket_url": "ws://127.0.0.1:9229/devtools/browser/<id>", "product": "Chrome/142.0.7444.265" } }
```

The port exists only for a fresh process. `launch` never quits a running app for you, because that loses the user's state. A running target returns `ACTION_FAILED` with `details.kind: "cdp_requires_fresh_launch"`. Run `close-app`, confirm the exit, then launch again with `--cdp`.

| `details.kind` | Meaning | Recovery |
|----------------|---------|----------|
| `cdp_requires_fresh_launch` | App already running | `close-app`, confirm exit, relaunch |
| `cdp_port_in_use` (`INVALID_ARGS`) | The named port is bound | Name another port, or omit it |
| `cdp_switch_conflict` (`INVALID_ARGS`) | `--arg` carried a `--remote-debugging-*` or `--remote-allow-origins` switch | Drop that `--arg` |
| `cdp_endpoint_unavailable` | No endpoint answered before the deadline | The app stays running. Use the accessibility path |

Handoff: agent-desktop never talks to the port itself. Check `command -v agent-browser`. If it exists, run `agent-browser connect <port>` and use its snapshot, click and type workflow (`agent-browser skills get electron` has the guide). Playwright, Puppeteer and other CDP clients also work. Do not write raw CDP by hand or call app-internal APIs. If no client exists, ask the user to run `npm install -g agent-browser`, or stay on the accessibility path.

Keep these on agent-desktop even with CDP connected: the native menu bar, file dialogs and sheets, window management, notifications, screenshots, and any app you did not launch. While the port is open, any local process of the same user can control the app's web contents. Request `--cdp` only for the step that needs it. `close-app` ends the exposure.

## close-app

```bash
agent-desktop close-app "TextEdit"
agent-desktop close-app "TextEdit" --force
```

Success is reported only after the process is seen gone: `{ "method": "graceful" | "force", "requested": true, "closed": true }`. If a save dialog appears, snapshot it and answer it. `--force` ends the process. Protected system processes return `INVALID_ARGS` with `not_delivered`, not `PERM_DENIED`.

## list-apps

Lists running GUI apps as `{ name, pid, bundle_id, presentation }`. `--app` filters by name substring. `presentation` is `foreground` (ordinary windows), `background` (no Dock entry, such as menu-bar items and hotkey overlays), or omitted (helper processes). Apps with no UI are excluded.

## Windows (OS windows)

```bash
agent-desktop list-windows --app "Finder"
agent-desktop focus-window --window-id w-4521
agent-desktop resize-window --app "TextEdit" --width 800 --height 600
agent-desktop move-window --app "TextEdit" --x 0 --y 0
agent-desktop minimize --app "TextEdit"   # maximize, restore likewise
```

- `list-windows` returns `{ id, title, app_name, pid, bounds, is_focused, accessible }`. Use a `w-<id>` with `--window-id` when an app has several windows.
- `accessible: false` means semantic commands cannot reach that window. Targeting it returns `ACTION_NOT_SUPPORTED` with `kind: "window_without_accessibility_element"`. It still accepts screenshots and coordinate input. Choose another window.
- `focus-window` needs at least one identifier. It confirms the OS reports that window as focused. Otherwise it returns `ACTION_FAILED`.
- `restore` undoes a minimize and returns the window to its earlier placement. It does not promise to un-maximize.

## Notifications

Commands: `list-notifications`, `dismiss-notification`, `dismiss-all-notifications`, `notification-action`, `wait --notification`. They drive the OS notification surface (Notification Center on macOS, Action Center on Windows). Command shapes and JSON fields are the same on both.

- Output is verbatim. Titles and bodies are not redacted. Treat anything you route onward as sensitive.
- Headless listing works only when the surface is already open. When it is closed, a strict-headless call returns `POLICY_DENIED`. Use `--headed`, which may open the surface and restore the earlier foreground app.
- Every mutation needs `--headed`. A single-notification mutation also needs a fingerprint from the same listing: `--expected-app` or `--expected-title`. Notifications reorder between listings. When the row at the index no longer matches, the call returns `NOTIFICATION_NOT_FOUND` and presses nothing. Without a fingerprint, `INVALID_ARGS`.
- `list-notifications` returns `{ index, app_name, title, body, actions }`, with 1-based indexes. `--app`, `--text`, `--limit` filter.
- `notification-action INDEX "Reply"` clicks a named button. An action the entry lacks returns `ACTION_NOT_SUPPORTED` and changes nothing.
- `dismiss-all-notifications` returns `{ dismissed_count, failures, failed_count }`. A failure to close the surface afterward is not reported as an error.
- `wait --notification` detects a new entry against a baseline taken at wait start. Transient errors retry within `--timeout`. A headless wait sees only an already-open surface.

## Clipboard

```bash
agent-desktop clipboard-get --format auto
agent-desktop clipboard-get --format image --out /tmp/clip.png
agent-desktop clipboard-set "Hello"
agent-desktop clipboard-set --image /tmp/a.png
agent-desktop clipboard-set --file-url /tmp/a.txt --file-url /tmp/b.txt
agent-desktop clipboard-clear
```

- Formats: `text` (default), `auto` (file references, then image, then text), `image`, `file-urls`. Output is `{ "type": "text", "text": ... }`, `{ "type": "file_urls", ... }`, or `{ "type": "image", "path", "width", "height" }`. When the clipboard has nothing in that form: `{ "type": "<format>", "found": false }`.
- Image bytes go to `--out`, or to a private file under the active session directory (or `~/.agent-desktop/tmp`).
- `clipboard-set` writes one representation per call. `--file-url` and `--image` win over the positional text. Every `--file-url` path must exist, or `INVALID_ARGS`.
- A write that loses clipboard ownership mid-way reports `delivered_unverified`, not a false success.

## wait

```bash
agent-desktop wait 1000
agent-desktop wait --element @s8f3k2p9:e5 --predicate actionable --action type --timeout 5000
agent-desktop wait --element @s8f3k2p9:e5 --predicate value --value "Done"
agent-desktop wait --window "Save As" --app "TextEdit"
agent-desktop wait --text "Loading complete" --app "Safari"
agent-desktop wait --menu --app "Finder"
agent-desktop wait --event window-opened --app "Finder"
```

Use `wait`, not a fixed sleep. `--timeout` defaults to 30000 ms. Modes:

- **Time.** `wait <ms>` pauses.
- **Element.** `--predicate` is `exists` (default), `enabled`, `visible`, `actionable`, or `value` (with `--value`). `actionable` checks readiness for `--action` (`click` default, `type`, `set-value`, `clear`). Use `--action type` before a wait-then-type flow. The editability check runs only for editing actions. `--element` takes a qualified ref (`@<snapshot_id>:eN`); the wait polls the snapshot embedded in the ref.
- **Window.** Waits for a window whose title contains the text. `--app` narrows. On timeout, `details.last_observed` lists the scoped window count and up to eight titles.
- **Text.** Waits for text anywhere in the app's tree. `--count` adds a count to the result.
- **Menu.** `--menu` waits for a menu surface to open. `--menu-closed` waits for it to close.
- **Event.** `--event` is one of `window-opened`, `window-closed`, `app-launched`, `app-terminated`, `focus-changed`, `surface-appeared`, `surface-dismissed`. It diffs a baseline taken at wait start against fresh reads, so you need no window id up front. `--window-id` and `--window` narrow it.

For `wait --event` only, `--app` resolves once, at wait start, to one process instance. (`wait --window` filters by app name on every poll.) A later process of the same name is invisible to the wait. Two running instances return `AMBIGUOUS_TARGET`. When no app matches:

- `app-launched`, `window-opened`, `surface-appeared`: keep polling until the timeout. Use these when you race a launch.
- `app-terminated`, `window-closed`, `surface-dismissed`: return `"found": true` with `"target_unresolved": true` at once. A misspelled `--app` gives the same answer, so check the name.
- `focus-changed`: returns `APP_NOT_FOUND`.

A `TIMEOUT` from `wait` carries `details.kind: "wait_timeout"`, `last_observed` or `last_error`, and `baseline_counts` for events.

## batch

```bash
agent-desktop batch '[
  {"command":"click","args":{"ref_id":"@s8f3k2p9:e1"}},
  {"command":"wait","args":{"ms":200}},
  {"command":"type","args":{"ref_id":"@s8f3k2p9:e2","text":"hello"}}
]' --stop-on-error
```

Batch runs entries in order in one process. It is not a transaction. Entries use the same typed commands, policy checks and dispatch as the CLI. Use `args`, not `params`. Unknown fields are rejected, and nested `batch` is rejected. Pass `--stop-on-error` to halt at the first failure. Each entry may carry `"session": "id"`, otherwise it inherits the top-level session. An entry whose session ended before dispatch is `not_started` with reason `session_ended`. Snapshot args use `skeleton`, `root`, `interactive_only`.

## Sessions and traces

A session is an on-disk container under `<state root>/sessions/<id>/` with a manifest, snapshot refmaps and, when tracing is on, a `trace/` directory. The state root is `~/.agent-desktop`. `AGENT_DESKTOP_HOME` relocates it. It must be an absolute path, or the command fails with `INVALID_ARGS`. `status` reports it as `state_root`.

```bash
agent-desktop session start --name "invoice-bot"
export AGENT_DESKTOP_SESSION=<session_id>    # PowerShell: $env:AGENT_DESKTOP_SESSION = "<session_id>"
agent-desktop session end "$AGENT_DESKTOP_SESSION"
```

- `session start` creates the session and prints `{ session_id, name, trace, created_at }`. `session start` does not activate later processes. Pass the id with global `--session <id>` or `AGENT_DESKTOP_SESSION`. `--session` wins over the variable. With neither, commands use the global namespace.
- A session owns its trace and its latest-snapshot namespace. Lookup never searches another session. A session-owned ref still requires the same `--session` or `AGENT_DESKTOP_SESSION` scope, even though a qualified ref embeds its snapshot id.
- Tracing needs a manifest with `trace: on` (the default). `--no-trace`, or a bare `--session <id>` without a manifest, gives a namespace with no trace files. `--trace <path>` overrides to one file. `--trace-strict` fails on trace setup errors.
- `--screenshots` records pre and post PNGs and refmap copies. They are unredacted and sensitive. They need tracing on.
- Several agents may share one session id. Each should use qualified refs from its own snapshot.
- `session list`, `session end [id]` and `session gc` list, seal and reclaim sessions. `gc` never reaps a live session.
- `trace show [--limit N] [--event PREFIX]` returns the merged event timeline (default tail 500, `0` for all). `trace export [--out path.html]` writes a self-contained HTML viewer. Both need no OS permission.
- Trace lines redact sensitive fields (`text`, `value`, `name`, `title`, `url`, ...) to `{ "redacted": true }`.
- `status` shows `session_id`, `tracing` and `artifacts`.

### Cursor overlay

`cursor-overlay enable` draws an agent cursor and ripple for actions. It affects presentation only. `enable` returns `data.rendered`. Read it: `false` means the setting was saved but nothing was drawn. The styling flags are listed by `agent-desktop cursor-overlay enable --help`. `session start --cursor` enables it at start.

On macOS, motion flags on `cursor-overlay enable` are stored with the session or per-agent profile: `--travel-ms MIN,MAX` (default `90,320`, `30 ≤ MIN ≤ MAX`), `--bow N` (0–3, default 1), `--overshoot N` (0–0.15, default 0.035), `--tremor PX` (0–4 points, default 1.1), `--dwell-ms N` (0–300, default 0), and `--motion-seed N` (deterministic variation per move, off by default). `--aim-spread N` (0–1, default 0) varies where a ref action lands inside its control: a point in the control's central area of that fraction of its size, weighted towards the middle, different on every move; a cursor already resting in that area clicks where it is. `--drift-off` moves the cursor off a clicked control 0.4 to 0.9 s after the click, unless the next action arrives first. Both are presentation only, for semantic delivery; physical delivery always lands on its verified point, and both draw from `--motion-seed` when set. Travel max plus dwell must be ≤700 ms or the command returns `INVALID_ARGS`; the arrival budget remains 900 ms. On macOS, Reduce Motion skips travel and dwell, and physical headed drags keep their own motion. After upgrading, run `cursor-overlay disable` then `enable` to restart the renderer with the new settings.

On macOS, image flags on `cursor-overlay enable`: `--image PATH` replaces the arrow with a PNG of at most 2 MiB and 1024 pixels per side; `--hotspot X,Y` sets its click point in image points from the top-left (default `0,0`). `--pointer-image PATH` and `--pointer-hotspot X,Y` optionally show a second PNG on arrival at a pressable control, and `--text-image PATH` and `--text-hotspot X,Y` a third on arrival at a text field, combo box or date field. After each move and effect the renderer hit-tests the element under the resting cursor and shows the image for it or its nearest pressable or text ancestor, so the pointer stays on a button and gives way to the arrow when a click opens a dialog under it. A shape without an image draws the arrow, and the next travel departs as the arrow again. Relative paths are resolved at enable; only absolute paths cross the socket. `--fill`/`--rim` conflict with `--image`; `--size` scales the image and `--accent` colours effects. Images rasterize at display backing scale, scale down to fit the stage, draw without an added shadow, and fall back to the arrow if missing or invalid. Settings persist in session and per-agent profiles. Windows accepts these motion and image settings but keeps its built-in motion and arrow. After upgrading, run `cursor-overlay disable` then `enable` to restart the renderer.

Multi-agent cursors (macOS and Windows): start with `session start --cursor --multi-agent`, then pass the returned session id to every subagent.

- Desktop UI actions then require an agent id: global `--agent-id <id>` or `AGENT_DESKTOP_AGENT_ID`. The flag wins. Observations, clipboard commands and session administration do not need one.
- An id has 1 to 64 letters, digits, `-` or `_`. It is scoped by session. Each distinct id gets its own cursor, and a reused id reuses its cursor.
- `--agent-id <id> cursor-overlay enable` saves a style for that agent. Do not add `--multi-agent` to it.
- `cursor-overlay disable` and `session end` stop every cursor in the session, even when you pass an agent id.

## status, permissions, version

- `status` returns adapter health, platform, the permission report, `supported_surfaces`, the latest snapshot (`snapshot_id`, `ref_count`), `session_id`, `tracing`, `state_root`.
- `permissions` returns `accessibility`, `screen_recording` and `automation`, each as `{ "state": "granted" | "denied" | "not_required" | "unknown" }`, with a `suggestion` when denied. It is cached per process. `permissions --request` asks the OS to prompt, through a bounded isolated helper so a stalled prompt cannot hang the command. It is the only path that prompts. What to grant is in the platform skill.
- `version` returns `{ version, target, os }`.

## skills
