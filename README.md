**agent-desktop** gives any agent reliable computer use on the desktop. Built with Rust, it sees any app's real UI structure through OS accessibility trees and operates it — refs stay stable and actions stay safe to retry, instead of guessing from pixels.

## Key Features

- **Native Rust CLI**: Fast, single binary, no runtime dependencies
- **C-ABI cdylib** (`libagent_desktop_ffi`): Load once from Python / Swift / Go / Ruby / Node / C instead of forking the CLI per call
- **60 command names, 56 operational commands**: Observation, interaction, keyboard, mouse, notifications, shell surfaces, clipboard, window management, session lifecycle, trace read/export, plus a bundled `skills` doc loader. The four held-input names are reserved for a stateful daemon and fail closed in the stateless CLI.
- **Progressive skeleton traversal**: 78–96% token reduction on dense apps via shallow overview + targeted drill-down
- **Snapshot & refs**: AI-optimized workflow using compact snapshot IDs and qualified element references (`@s8f3k2p9:e1`, `@s8f3k2p9:e2`)
- **Headless-by-default interactions**: Ref actions use accessibility APIs and block silent focus, cursor, keyboard, or pasteboard side effects
- **Structured JSON output**: Machine-readable responses with error codes and recovery hints
- **Works with any app**: Finder, Safari, System Settings, Xcode, Slack — anything with an accessibility tree
- **Chromium-app interop via CDP**: `launch --cdp` opens a verified DevTools port so any framework that speaks CDP — Playwright, Puppeteer, `chrome-remote-interface`, agent-browser — can drive the web contents, while native menus, dialogs, and windows stay on the accessibility path

## Installation

### npm (recommended)

```bash
npm install -g agent-desktop        # downloads prebuilt binary automatically
```

The same command installs on macOS (ARM64, x64) and Windows (x64, ARM64). The installer downloads a `.tar.gz` release asset, verifies its SHA-256 against the release's `checksums.txt`, and places the native binary beside the `agent-desktop` launcher.

Recent npm versions block install scripts by default, which prevents the wrapper from fetching its binary and produces a loud binary-not-found failure on first run. To permit this package's install script, add the `allowScripts` configuration to your `package.json` (or npm config):

```json
{
  "allowScripts": {
    "agent-desktop": true
  }
}
```

Or via npm config:

```bash
npm config set allowScripts.agent-desktop true
```

Or without installing:

```bash
npx agent-desktop snapshot --app Finder -i
```

### Direct download

Windows binaries are also published as GitHub Release assets:

- `agent-desktop-v<version>-x86_64-pc-windows-msvc.tar.gz`
- `agent-desktop-v<version>-aarch64-pc-windows-msvc.tar.gz`

Each archive contains one entry, `agent-desktop.exe`. Verify a manual download before running it:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://github.com/lahfir/agent-desktop/releases/download/v<version>/checksums.txt
sha256sum <downloaded-archive>   # compare with the matching checksums.txt line
gh attestation verify <downloaded-archive> --repo lahfir/agent-desktop
```

The checksums published beside a release come from the same release as the artifact they describe, so they detect corruption rather than proving provenance. A reader who downloads an artifact manually can verify provenance with `gh attestation verify <file> --repo lahfir/agent-desktop`.

### From source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/lahfir/agent-desktop
cd agent-desktop
cargo build --release
cp target/release/agent-desktop /usr/local/bin/
```

Requires Rust 1.89+. On macOS this means macOS 13.0+ with the Xcode command-line tools; on Windows it requires the MSVC toolchain (Visual Studio Build Tools with the "Desktop development with C++" workload).

On macOS, application names use AppKit's localized display name. If it is unavailable, the inventory uses the executable name, then the bundle identifier, while retaining the application's process identity.

### Permissions

macOS requires Accessibility permission. Screenshots also require Screen Recording permission, and the Notification Center opener requires Automation permission for System Events. Plain permission checks never prompt. Request missing permissions in a bounded isolated helper with:

```bash
agent-desktop permissions --request   # request missing permissions in an isolated helper
```

Windows needs no permission grant for reading or acting on applications at the same integrity level as your terminal: UI Automation requires no TCC-style consent. An elevated target (an app running as administrator) can only be driven by an elevated agent, because UIPI blocks synthesized input across that boundary while reads still succeed. Because the shipped binary is unsigned, three Windows execution controls may still intervene: a browser-downloaded copy shows the SmartScreen warning on first GUI launch (the npm install path attaches no Mark-of-the-Web, so no prompt fires there), antivirus software may quarantine a freshly downloaded unsigned executable, and Smart App Control on a clean Windows 11 install blocks unknown unsigned executables at process creation regardless of launch mode.

Permission fields are explicit objects, for example:

```json
{
  "accessibility": { "state": "granted" },
  "screen_recording": { "state": "denied", "suggestion": "Grant Screen Recording permission" },
  "automation": { "state": "unknown" }
}
```

Automation reports `granted`, `denied`, or `unknown`; `unknown` means macOS would need to prompt or System Events could not be probed without prompting.

## Language bindings (FFI)

Every GitHub Release ships a prebuilt C-ABI cdylib (`libagent_desktop_ffi`) for macOS, Linux, and Windows alongside the CLI tarballs. `dlopen` it and call the functions declared in `agent_desktop.h` for in-process calls instead of fork-exec per command.

```python
import ctypes
lib = ctypes.CDLL("./lib/libagent_desktop_ffi.dylib")
lib.ad_init(4)  # verify ABI major (AD_ABI_VERSION_MAJOR) before any call
adapter = lib.ad_adapter_create()
# observe -> act: ad_snapshot -> parse a qualified ref -> ad_execute_by_ref ...
lib.ad_adapter_destroy(adapter)
```

Full consumer guide — entrypoints, ownership, threading, error-handling, build/link, release archives, and verification: **[`skills/agent-desktop-ffi/`](skills/agent-desktop-ffi/)**.

## Core Workflow for AI

> **Shell syntax.** The examples below are POSIX shell (zsh, bash). In Windows
> PowerShell, quote every ref (`'@s8f3k2p9:e1'`) — a bare `@token` is the
> splatting operator and the argument disappears — use `$env:NAME = 'value'`
> instead of `export`, and `$r = agent-desktop ... | ConvertFrom-Json` instead
> of `$(...)` and `jq`.

For dense apps (Slack, VS Code, Notion), use **progressive skeleton traversal** to minimize token usage:

```bash
# 1. Shallow overview — depth-3 map, truncated containers show children_count
agent-desktop snapshot --skeleton --app Slack -i --compact
# Refs are qualified with their snapshot ID, for example @s8f3k2p9:e3

# 2. Drill into a region of interest (each truncated branch exposes a safe drill ref)
agent-desktop snapshot --root @s8f3k2p9:e3 -i --compact

# 3. Act on an element found in the drill-down
agent-desktop click @s8f3k2p9:e12

# 4. Re-drill the same region to verify the state change
agent-desktop snapshot --root @s8f3k2p9:e3 -i --compact
```

For simple apps, a full snapshot is fine:

```bash
agent-desktop snapshot --app Finder -i   # get interactive elements with qualified refs
agent-desktop click @s8f3k2p9:e3  # click a button by ref
agent-desktop type @s8f3k2p9:e5 "quarterly report"  # insert text into a field
agent-desktop press cmd+s               # keyboard shortcut
agent-desktop snapshot -i               # re-observe after UI changes
```

```
Agent loop:  snapshot → decide → act → snapshot → decide → act → ...
```

### Trace viewer (read back a session)

```bash
session_id=$(agent-desktop session start --screenshots | jq -r '.data.session_id')
export AGENT_DESKTOP_SESSION="$session_id"
agent-desktop snapshot --app Finder -i       # work inside the explicit session scope
agent-desktop click @s8f3k2p9:e5
agent-desktop trace show --limit 500         # bounded JSON timeline for agents
agent-desktop trace export --out run.html    # single-file HTML viewer (works from file://)
```

`trace show` merges all segment files deterministically and requires no permissions. `trace export` embeds the timeline plus screenshots as base64 in one static HTML file. Without `--out`, the HTML is written to the session directory (`~/.agent-desktop/sessions/<id>/trace-<id>.html`), not the current directory; `--out` overrides the path. Treat exported HTML like a screenshot when `artifacts: full` was enabled.

### Shared sessions for multi-agent workflows

Run `session start` once per agent run to create a trace-enabled session (manifest `trace: on` by default), then pass the returned ID with global `--session <id>` or `AGENT_DESKTOP_SESSION=<id>`. Commands in that explicit scope get automatic JSONL segments under `~/.agent-desktop/sessions/<id>/trace/` and share the session's latest-snapshot namespace — no `--trace` on every call.

For concurrent **independent** agents, set `AGENT_DESKTOP_SESSION=<id>` per process. When multiple agents share one session ID, each agent should act on the qualified refs from its own `snapshot` call rather than assuming the namespace's latest snapshot is unchanged.

Bare `--session <id>` without a manifest (no `session start`) still scopes the snapshot namespace only and writes no trace files. Snapshot IDs resolve only inside the selected session namespace; they never trigger a cross-session search.

```bash
agent-desktop session start --name release-fix          # note data.session_id
export AGENT_DESKTOP_SESSION=<session_id>
agent-desktop snapshot --app Xcode -i --compact          # uses selected session + tracing
agent-desktop wait --element @s8f3k2p9:e9 --predicate actionable --timeout 5000
agent-desktop click @s8f3k2p9:e9
agent-desktop session end "$AGENT_DESKTOP_SESSION"
agent-desktop session gc
```

### Agent cursor overlay

A presentation-only cursor that shows what the agent is about to do. Off by
default. Renders on macOS and Windows; other platforms record the setting
without drawing.

On macOS agent cursors work in both headless and headed mode, including
physical pointer commands. Drags follow the cursor's curved motion and draw an
accent-colored trail while held, then fade after release. Each agent retains
its own cursor; the existing interaction lease coordinates the shared OS
pointer.

On Windows the overlay draws only for headless semantic actions — a `--headed`
command sends real pointer input and the overlay is suppressed for that
command only — and it does not collapse under the OS's reduce-motion
accessibility preference the way macOS does, a deliberate difference documented
with its cost in `skills/agent-desktop-windows/SKILL.md`.

```bash
session_id=$(agent-desktop session start --cursor | jq -r '.data.session_id')
export AGENT_DESKTOP_SESSION="$session_id"
agent-desktop snapshot --app Finder -i
agent-desktop click <qualified-ref-from-snapshot>
agent-desktop cursor-overlay disable
```

`session start --cursor` turns it on with the default look. `cursor-overlay enable` does the same for a session that already exists.

**Style defaults belong to the session.** Set them once; later commands inherit them. Named agents can save their own style using global `--agent-id`.

```bash
agent-desktop --session "$session_id" cursor-overlay enable --label "Opening the menu"
export AGENT_DESKTOP_SESSION="$session_id"
```

For harness subagents on macOS, start one shared session and give each worker a stable ID:

```bash
session_id=$(agent-desktop session start --cursor --multi-agent | jq -r '.data.session_id')
export AGENT_DESKTOP_SESSION="$session_id"
# Set a different ID in each subagent's environment:
export AGENT_DESKTOP_AGENT_ID=researcher
agent-desktop cursor-overlay enable --label "Checking details" --accent "#FF3B7B"
agent-desktop snapshot --app Finder -i
agent-desktop click <qualified-ref-from-snapshot>
```

The style command is optional and saves settings for the next presentation without creating a cursor. Each distinct agent ID gets its own cursor on first presentation; three IDs produce three cursors, with no extra coordinator cursor. IDs use 1–64 letters, digits, `-` or `_`. Global `--agent-id` overrides the environment. In multi-agent mode, desktop UI actions require an ID; observations, clipboard operations, and session administration do not. Snapshots remain shared by session, so pin qualified refs and coordinate actions on shared UI. `cursor-overlay disable` or `session end` stops every cursor, even when an agent ID is set. To enable this mode on an existing session, run `cursor-overlay enable --multi-agent` without an agent ID.

| Flag | Meaning | Default |
|---|---|---|
| `--label TEXT` | Intent text beside the cursor | none |
| `--max-words N` | Label word limit, 1–12 | 6 |
| `--fill HEX` | Cursor body | `#FFFFFF` |
| `--rim HEX` | Cursor outline | `#111318` |
| `--accent HEX` | Ripple and element outline | `#4299FF` |
| `--size N` | Size multiplier, 0.5–4.0 | 1.0 |
| `--no-ripple` | No ripple on click | ripple on |
| `--no-highlight` | No element outline on click | outline on |
| `--image PATH` | PNG drawn instead of the arrow, scaled by `--size` | arrow |
| `--hotspot X,Y` | Click point in the image, points from its top-left | `0,0` |
| `--pointer-image PATH` | Image shown on arrival over buttons, links and other pressable controls | arrow |
| `--pointer-hotspot X,Y` | Click point in the pointer image | `0,0` |
| `--text-image PATH` | Image shown over text fields and other controls that take typed text | arrow |
| `--text-hotspot X,Y` | Click point in the text image | `0,0` |

`cursor-overlay enable` also accepts `--travel-ms`, `--bow`, `--overshoot`, `--tremor`, `--dwell-ms` and `--motion-seed` for session or per-agent motion profiles; see the [system command reference](skills/agent-desktop/references/commands-system.md#cursor-overlay).

**Behaviour**

- The cursor travels a human path in 90–320 ms. It never rotates or resizes.
- `--image` swaps the arrow for your PNG (≤ 2 MiB). Fill and rim do not apply; accent still drives the ripple, outline and trail. Oversized images are scaled down to fit the cursor stage, and a missing file falls back to the arrow. `--pointer-image` adds a second image, such as a pointing hand, shown when a ref action lands on a button, link or other pressable control, and on coordinate clicks. `--text-image` adds a third, such as an I-beam, for text fields. While the cursor rests, the renderer re-reads what lies under it, so the pointer stays on a button and gives way to the arrow when a dialog opens.
- The action waits up to 900 ms for cursor arrival confirmation. If the renderer does not confirm in time, a warning is reported and the action proceeds.
- A click plays a ripple, then flashes an accent outline around the element for 0.9 s. Both draw below the cursor.
- Idle for 6 s, it fades out. The next command brings it back.
- `cursor-overlay disable` removes it now and stops the renderer. You do not
  have to end the session. If a session ends without a `disable` — a crash,
  `session gc` — the renderer reclaims itself within a few seconds regardless.
- Headed actions retain it on macOS and hide it on Windows. It never moves or
  intercepts the OS pointer on either.
- Overhead is about 150–300 ms per action, all of it the visible travel. On
  Windows the control-pipe roundtrip itself measures a fraction of a
  millisecond; the travel animation is the cost.

macOS and Windows render it natively — on Windows it also draws above the
shell's own topmost chrome, including the taskbar. Linux inherits the
adapter's no-op and needs its own renderer against the same core contract.

## Driving Chromium apps (CDP)

For a Chromium-based app (Slack, VS Code, Discord, Obsidian, Notion), `launch --cdp` opens a verified Chrome DevTools Protocol endpoint on the web contents. Any framework that speaks CDP can connect — Playwright, Puppeteer, `chrome-remote-interface`, agent-browser — with agent-browser preferred for its ref-based agent workflow and bundled `electron` skill. Native surfaces (menus, dialogs, windows, screenshots) stay on the accessibility path either way.

```bash
agent-desktop launch "Obsidian" --cdp
```

```json
{ "app": "Obsidian", "pid": 4821, "cdp": {
  "port": 9229,
  "http_endpoint": "http://127.0.0.1:9229",
  "websocket_url": "ws://127.0.0.1:9229/devtools/browser/<id>",
  "product": "Chrome/142.0.7444.265"
},
  "suggestion": "Next: run `agent-browser connect 9229` (preferred) or connect any CDP client such as Playwright or Puppeteer. ..." }
```

`--cdp` needs a fresh launch — an already-running target returns `ACTION_FAILED`. Run `close-app` first, confirm the process exited, then `launch --cdp` again.

The endpoint is pinned to `127.0.0.1`. Any local process running as your user can still reach it while it stays open; `close-app` ends the exposure along with the app.

## Commands

### Observation

```bash
agent-desktop snapshot --app Safari -i           # accessibility tree with refs
agent-desktop snapshot --surface menu            # capture open menu
agent-desktop screenshot --app Finder            # PNG screenshot
agent-desktop find --role button --app TextEdit  # search by role, name, value, text
agent-desktop get @s8f3k2p9:e3 --property value  # read element property
agent-desktop is @s8f3k2p9:e7 --property checked # check boolean state
agent-desktop list-surfaces --app Notes          # list menus, sheets, popovers, alerts
```

`get` and `is` resolve the ref once, prefer live platform reads when available, and fall back only when that live read is unsupported by the adapter.

### Interaction

```bash
agent-desktop click @s8f3k2p9:e3                  # strict headless AX click
agent-desktop --headed click @s8f3k2p9:e3         # physical click, focus/cursor allowed
agent-desktop --headed double-click @s8f3k2p9:e3  # physical double-click
agent-desktop --headed triple-click @s8f3k2p9:e3  # physical triple-click
agent-desktop right-click @s8f3k2p9:e3            # open context menu; inspect effect before retrying
agent-desktop type @s8f3k2p9:e5 "hello world"     # insert text into element
agent-desktop set-value @s8f3k2p9:e5 "new value"  # set value directly via AX
agent-desktop clear @s8f3k2p9:e5                  # clear element value
agent-desktop focus @s8f3k2p9:e5                  # set keyboard focus
agent-desktop select @s8f3k2p9:e9 "Option B"      # select verified dropdown/list option
agent-desktop toggle @s8f3k2p9:e12                # flip checkbox or switch
agent-desktop check @s8f3k2p9:e12                 # idempotent check
agent-desktop uncheck @s8f3k2p9:e12               # idempotent uncheck
agent-desktop expand @s8f3k2p9:e15                # expand disclosure/tree item
agent-desktop collapse @s8f3k2p9:e15              # collapse disclosure/tree item
agent-desktop scroll @s8f3k2p9:e1 --direction down --amount 3  # strict headless AX scroll
agent-desktop scroll-to @s8f3k2p9:e20             # scroll element into view
```

> **(macOS, Phase 1)** Default ref actions are strict headless semantic operations. In headed mode, core focuses the exact ref window before dispatch; pointer commands additionally require a verified target point, while the adapter owns physical delivery. `click`, `right-click`, `type`, `clear`, and `scroll` are physical-first; double/triple-click, hover, and drag are physical-only; expand/collapse and other semantic commands remain semantic. Raw coordinates never imply a target window and therefore never steal focus. See `skills/agent-desktop/references/commands-interaction.md`.

### Keyboard

```bash
agent-desktop press cmd+s               # key combo
agent-desktop press cmd+shift+z          # multi-modifier
agent-desktop press escape               # single key
```

`key-down` and `key-up` are reserved command names and return `ACTION_NOT_SUPPORTED` until a stateful daemon can own the held-key lifetime.

### Mouse

```bash
agent-desktop --headed hover @s8f3k2p9:e3                  # move cursor to element
agent-desktop --headed hover --xy 500,300         # move cursor to coordinates
agent-desktop --headed drag --from @s8f3k2p9:e3 --to @s8f3k2p9:e8   # drag between elements
agent-desktop --headed drag --from-xy 100,200 --to-xy 400,200  # drag between coordinates
agent-desktop --headed mouse-click --xy 500,300   # click at coordinates
```

`mouse-down` and `mouse-up` are likewise reserved; use the atomic `mouse-click` or `drag` commands.

### App & Window Management

```bash
agent-desktop launch Safari              # launch app by name
agent-desktop launch com.apple.Safari    # launch by bundle ID
agent-desktop launch "Obsidian" --cdp    # fresh launch + verified CDP port for web contents
agent-desktop close-app Safari           # quit app
agent-desktop close-app Safari --force   # force quit (SIGTERM, then SIGKILL if needed)
agent-desktop list-apps                  # list running GUI apps
agent-desktop list-windows               # list visible windows
agent-desktop list-windows --app Finder  # windows for specific app
agent-desktop focus-window --window-id w-4521  # bring exact window to front
agent-desktop resize-window --window-id w-4521 --width 800 --height 600
agent-desktop move-window --window-id w-4521 --x 100 --y 100
agent-desktop minimize --window-id w-4521
agent-desktop maximize --window-id w-4521
agent-desktop restore --window-id w-4521
agent-desktop --headed open-system-surface --surface action-center  # raise a shell surface (Windows), returns the window it presents
```

### Notifications *(macOS, Windows)*

```bash
agent-desktop --headed list-notifications              # open Notification Center if needed, then list
agent-desktop --headed list-notifications --app "Slack"         # filter by app
agent-desktop --headed list-notifications --text "deploy" --limit 5  # filter by text
agent-desktop --headed dismiss-notification 1 --expected-app "Slack" --expected-title "Deploy complete"
agent-desktop --headed dismiss-all-notifications                # dismiss all
agent-desktop --headed dismiss-all-notifications --app "Slack"  # dismiss all from app
agent-desktop --headed notification-action 1 "Reply" --expected-app "Slack" --expected-title "Deploy complete"
```

Single-notification mutations require an app or title fingerprint from the
same listing. Every mutation requires `--headed` because it opens and focuses
the system notification surface. Headless listing can only observe an
already-open center; headed listing may open it and restore the prior
frontmost app afterward. On Windows these commands drive the Action Center
over UI Automation under the same foreground floor.

### Clipboard

```bash
agent-desktop clipboard-get              # read clipboard text
agent-desktop clipboard-set "copied"     # write to clipboard
agent-desktop clipboard-clear            # clear clipboard
```

### Wait

```bash
agent-desktop wait 500                                       # sleep 500ms
agent-desktop wait --element @s8f3k2p9:e3 --timeout 5000              # wait for element
agent-desktop wait --element @s8f3k2p9:e3 --predicate actionable      # wait until safe to act
agent-desktop wait --element @s8f3k2p9:e5 --predicate value --value ready
agent-desktop wait --window "Save" --timeout 10000           # wait for window
agent-desktop wait --text "Loading complete" --app Safari    # wait for text
agent-desktop wait --text "Done" --count 1 --app Xcode       # wait for exact match count
agent-desktop wait --notification --text "Build Succeeded"   # wait for new matching notification
agent-desktop wait --menu --timeout 3000                     # wait for menu
```

### Batch

```bash
agent-desktop batch '[
  {"command": "click", "args": {"ref_id": "@<snapshot_id>:e2"}},
  {"command": "type", "args": {"ref_id": "@<snapshot_id>:e5", "text": "hello"}},
  {"command": "press", "args": {"combo": "return"}}
]' --stop-on-error

agent-desktop --session run-a batch '[
  {"command": "snapshot", "args": {"app": "Finder", "interactive_only": true}},
  {"command": "status", "session": "run-b", "args": {}}
]'
```

### System

```bash
agent-desktop session start [--name LABEL] [--no-trace] [--cursor [--multi-agent]]  # create session; pass returned ID explicitly
agent-desktop session end [id]

## Snapshot Options

```bash
agent-desktop snapshot [OPTIONS]
```

| Flag | Default | Description |
|------|---------|-------------|
| `--app <NAME>` | focused app | Filter to a specific application |
| `--window-id <ID>` | - | Filter to a specific window |
| `-i` / `--interactive-only` | off | Only include interactive elements |
| `--compact` | off | Omit empty structural nodes |
| `--include-bounds` | off | Include pixel bounds (x, y, width, height) |
| `--max-depth <N>` | 10 | Maximum tree depth |
| `--skeleton` | off | Shallow 3-level overview; truncated containers show `children_count` and get refs as drill targets |
| `--root <REF>` | - | Start traversal from this ref; merges into existing refmap with scoped invalidation |
| `--surface <TYPE>` | window | `window`, `focused`, `menu`, `menubar`, `sheet`, `popover`, `alert`; Windows also serves the shell kinds `taskbar`, `system-tray`, `system-tray-overflow`, `start-menu`, `action-center` |

## JSON Output

See the [versioned JSON envelope, error-code, and exit-code contract](docs/json-output.md).

## Ref System

`snapshot` assigns local positions in depth-first order and emits qualified refs such as `@s8f3k2p9:e1`, `@s8f3k2p9:e2`, and `@s8f3k2p9:e3`. A qualified ref embeds the exact snapshot ID. Bare refs such as `@e3` are rejected with `INVALID_ARGS`. Snapshot lookup stays inside the selected session namespace.

Interactive roles that receive refs: `button`, `textfield`, `checkbox`, `link`, `menuitem`, `tab`, `slider`, `combobox`, `treeitem`, `cell`, `radiobutton`, `incrementor`, `menubutton`, `switch`, `colorwell`, `dockitem`.

Static elements (labels, groups, containers) appear in the tree for context but have no ref.

Reliability contract:

- `session start` creates and returns a manifest-gated session with automatic trace segments. It does not activate later processes. Activation resolves explicit `--session` first, then `AGENT_DESKTOP_SESSION`; otherwise the command uses the global, non-session namespace.
- Bare `--session <id>` without a manifest scopes snapshots only — no surprise trace files for existing callers.
- Snapshot lookup is confined to the selected namespace. A session-owned snapshot requires the same explicit `--session` or `AGENT_DESKTOP_SESSION` scope.
- Ref actions re-identify targets at action time: a moved unique target can proceed, while missing or changed stable identity returns `STALE_REF`.
- Mutable value text is not treated as stable identity, so text fields and timers can keep resolving when the saved window, path, role, and bounds evidence still identify the same element.
- Multiple plausible targets return `AMBIGUOUS_TARGET` instead of choosing arbitrarily.
- Actions run an actionability preflight before dispatch: visibility, stability, enabled state, supported action, policy, and editability.
- `wait --element @s8f3k2p9:e3 --predicate actionable` polls until the target can be acted on.
- With an active trace-enabled session, JSONL segments land under `sessions/<id>/trace/<pid>-*.jsonl` automatically. `--trace <path>` overrides to one file; `--trace-strict` fails on setup and pre-action writes (post-action traces are best-effort).

Stale ref recovery:

```
snapshot → act → STALE_REF or AMBIGUOUS_TARGET? → wait/snapshot again → retry with the new ref
```

## Platform Support

| | macOS | Windows | Linux |
|---|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| Accessibility tree | **Yes** | Yes\* | Planned |
| Click / type / keyboard | **Yes** | **Yes** | Planned |
| Mouse input | **Yes** | **Yes** | Planned |
| Screenshot | **Yes** | **Yes** | Planned |
| Clipboard | **Yes** | **Yes** | Planned |
| App & window management | **Yes** | Yes\*\* | Planned |
| Notifications | **Yes** | **Yes** | Planned |
| Shell surfaces (`open-system-surface`) | Planned | **Yes** | Planned |

\* On Windows, `list-surfaces` inventories each process's `window` / `focused` / `sheet` / `menu` surfaces, and `snapshot --surface` additionally resolves the shell kinds (`taskbar`, `system-tray`, `system-tray-overflow`, `start-menu`, `action-center`) with no `--app`; `quick-settings` refuses on pre-Windows-11 builds with the surface that carries the capability named instead.
\*\* `launch` on Windows resolves an absolute path or a bare name found under System32 or the Windows directory — it cannot resolve display names such as "Google Chrome".

## Development

Every platform adapter compiles on its own OS only, so unscoped workspace commands fail on every host. Scope cargo to the host package set (this is the macOS set):

```bash
HOST_PKGS="-p agent-desktop-core -p agent-desktop-macos -p agent-desktop-linux -p agent-desktop -p agent-desktop-ffi"

cargo build $HOST_PKGS                          # debug build
cargo build --release -p agent-desktop          # optimized (<15MB)
cargo test $HOST_PKGS --lib                     # library tests
cargo clippy $HOST_PKGS --all-targets -- -D warnings  # lint (must pass with zero warnings)
```

On Windows the set is `-p agent-desktop-core -p agent-desktop-windows -p agent-desktop -p agent-desktop-ffi`. See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for the full gates.
